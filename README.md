## Description
Given a command-line application that allows for user input, when the application is launched, the user is presented with various options including the ability to view all departments, roles, and employees, add new departments, roles, and employees, and update existing employee roles. When the user selects the option to view all departments, they are presented with a formatted table displaying the department names and corresponding IDs. Similarly, selecting the option to view all roles displays the job titles, role IDs, associated department, and salary for each role. If the user chooses to view all employees, a formatted table is presented displaying relevant employee data including employee IDs, first and last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and the manager to which each employee reports. When the user selects the option to add a department, they are prompted to enter the name of the new department, which is then added to the database. Likewise, when adding a new role, the user is prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role, which is then added to the database. If the user chooses to add a new employee, they are prompted to enter the employee's first and last name, their role, and their manager. Finally, if the user selects the option to update an employee's role, they are prompted to select the employee to be updated and the new role to be assigned, with this information being promptly updated in the database. This approach offers a streamlined and efficient solution to the problem, removing the need for an HTML file and eliminating the need for repetitive prompts.


## My-Task
My task was to develop a command-line application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database. I had to present users with options such as viewing all departments, roles, and employees, adding new departments, roles, and employees, and updating employee roles.  
  
To accomplish this, I used technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, and Inquirer.js. I had to ensure that the application could retrieve and manipulate data from the MySQL database using queries, and present that data in a readable format to users. Additionally, I had to prompt users for input using Inquirer.js and update the database based on their input.

## Installation:
-Download and clone my repo through Github via https://github.com/nguyet33/Home-Wherever-LLC-SQL  
-OR you can launch the live application at: NO LIVE APPLICATION FOR THIS PROJECT!!!

## Usage:
Step 1: Download the Repo  
Step 2: Npm i to install all dependencies   
Step 3: Run the Source command for schema and seeds  
Step 4: Run "Node index.js" to initiate the inquirer  
Step 5: User input of the prompt desired
